Introduction
------------

Swing Explorer is a GUI tool for examining the internals of Java Swing GUIs. It
provides a graphical display of the user interface, along with inspectors that
show the structure and properties of the Swing and AWT Component objects that
it is composed of.

Swing Explorer also includes Java Agent functionality for monitoring the Event
Dispatch Thread ("EDT") to trace component additions, and detect EDT "violations".

Swing Explorer can be used as a command line tool or as a library.


Installation
------------

To install Swing Explorer, download the distribution from the
https://github.com/swingexplorer/swingexplorer/releases[Releases page] for the
https://github.com/swingexplorer[`swingexplorer` GitHub project].

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swing Explorer requires Java 1.8 or later.

Running Swing Explorer
----------------------

Using the swexpl command line tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swing Explorer comes with a tool called **swexpl** that makes it easy to launch Swing Explorer from the command line. You point it at your program's JARs and main class, and it takes care of pulling in Swing Explorer and calling the launcher.

The **swexpl** tool is found in the `bin/` subdirectory of the Swing Explorer distribution.

Usage:

```
swexpl [--no-agent] -cp <classpath> <mainclass>
```

Arguments:

* `-cp <classpath>`
** The path to your user program's classes. The `<classpath>` argument is a colon-separated list of paths to the JARs or classes in your program. There is no need to include the Swing Explorer JARs; they will be added automatically.
* `--no-agent`
** By default, Swing Explorer runs some instrumentation code as a Java Agent enabling additional EDT-monitoring functionality. If for some reason you need to disable this behavior, pass `--no-agent`, and it will run without the Agent functionality.
* `<mainclass>`
** The `<mainclass>` argument is the fully-qualified name of your program's main class.

You can also run Swing Explorer using the included "FrmPerson" example program by omitting the `-cp` option and using `sample.FrmPerson` as the mainclass.

Examples:

```
swexpl -cp path/to/MyProgram.jar com.example.myprogram.MainClass
swexpl --no-agent -cp path/to/MyProgram.jar com.example.myprogram.MainClass
swexpl sample.FrmPerson
```

On Windows, the `swexpl.bat` command serves the same purpose and takes the same arguments.

Using Swing Explorer as a library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use Swing Explorer as a library in your program. To do so, get the Swing Explorer JARs (`swingexplorer-agent-<version>.jar` and `swingexplorer-core-<version>.jar`) and their dependencies (found in the `lib/` directory of the distribution) on your Java classpath. Then either:

* Use `org.swingexplorer.Launcher` as the main class of your program, supplying the name of your own program's main class as a command line argument, or
* Call `org.swingexplorer.Launcher.launch()` after your program has started.

For examples on how this can be done, see the source code for `swexpl`, found in `bin/` in the Swing Explorer distribution, or in `src/dist-files/bin` in the `swingexplorer` repository.

Including Swing Explorer using Maven
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using Maven, then you can include Swing Explorer and its dependencies in your project simply by specifying a Maven dependency for Swing Explorer in your project's `pom.xml` file.

.POM.XML Dependency Definition
-----------------------------------
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.swingexplorer</groupId>
        <artifactId>swingexplorer</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.0</version>
    </dependency>
-----------------------------------


Swing Explorer IDE Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been some IDE plugins written to enable use of Swing Explorer inside Java IDEs. These
are distributed separately from Swing Explorer itself.

The JetBrains IntelliJ plugin for Swing Explorer can be found at
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8385-swingexplorer-integration-v2.

The Eclipse plugin for Swing Explorer is no longer readily available online, but if you happen
to have a copy of it sitting around, it will probably still work with the current
release of Swing Explorer.


The Swing Explorer interface
----------------------------

When you run Swing Explorer with a Java Swing application, Swing Explorer's interface 
is displayed as a separate top-level window ("Frame") in the Java program's UI. Its window
title will be "Swing Explorer".

Here is an example of the Swing Explorer interface window, when running the included
"sample.FrmPerson" example program.

image::images/ui_with_FrmPerson.png[]

There are five main parts to the Swing Explorer interface:

1. A toolbar, on the top.
2. The Swing component containment tree, on the left.
3. A view of the user program's Swing interface, in the center.
4. An info panel with various tabs, on the bottom right.
5. A status bar, on the far bottom.

image::images/swing_explorer_hints.jpg[]

The containment tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The left-hand side of the Swing Explorer UI holds a tree that shows the structure,
or containment relationships, of the Swing components in the explored user interface.

image::images/containment_tree.png[]

When the "All Roots" tab is selected, each root Frame or Window is displayed as the root
of the structure tree. When the "Displayed" tab is selected, the tree is rooted at
the selected component (the same one that is displayed in the user program view in
the center of the UI).

Each node in the tree is labeled with the simple class name of that component. Additional
information, such as a JLabel or JButton's text contents, or indictators of a special
component role like the glass pane or content pane in a JRootPane, are displayed in 
parentheses after the class name.

The user component view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The center area of the Swing Explorer UI contains a view of the user program's interface.
When you double-click on a component in the containment tree, that component becomes the 
top component displayed in the user component view area. The "Displayed:" readout above
the user component view reflects the class name of the displayed component.

The user program view will vary depending on what application you are running Swing
Explorer in. For example, here is Swing Explorer running with the classic "Swing Set"
demo application.

image::images/swing_explorer_swing_set.jpg[]

When you move your mouse over the user component view, it highlights components
and shows their sizes, including preferred size, size with border, and size without
border. These are the red and green outlines you see in the default configuration.
(The outline colors can be changed under Options.)

The info panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bottom right part of the Swing Explorer UI, immediately below the user component
view, is an info panel with various tabs. This area contains detailed info about 
selected components, and tools you can use to get more information about your Swing
interface.

The Properties tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Properties tab displays a listing of the JavaBeans style properties of the 
currently selected component. The "name" column shows the Bean property name.
The "value" column shows the toString() representation of the value of each
property.

image::images/tab_properties.png[]

Some specific commonly-used properties, like `border`, `class`, and `layout`,
are displayed at the top of the Properties list. All other properties are
displayed in alphabetical order below them.

The Addition trace tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Player tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Player tab records Swing method invocations and allows you to play them
back, watching their effects as they happen. When you select an event in
the Player tab, or play the events back, the user component view is updated
to show the component state as of that event.

image::images/tab_player_event_371.png[]

To play back events, press the right-triangle Play button 
(image:images/play_button.png[Play, title="Play"]).

image::images/player_event_playback.gif[]

You can step through events one at a time using the "<" and ">" buttons. And
you can "scrub" through the entire history of events using the slider on
the right hand side of the Player toolbar.

The AWT Events tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EDT monitor tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EDT monitor tab lets you monitor events related to the Swing Event
Dispatch Thread ("EDT"). These include:

* EDT violations, where something that should have happened on the EDT
was done on a different thread.
* EDT exceptions, where an unhandled thrown Exception "bubbles up" to the
top of the EDT's call stack.
* EDT hangs, where an operation on the EDT takes longer than a specified
time.

The EDT monitor tab looks like this:

image::images/tab_edt_monitor_empty.png[]

To turn on monitoring for any of those items, click the appropriate
check box at the top of the EDT monitor tab's panel. Monitoring will
continue as long as the check box is checked. You can tell that monitoring
is active because an animated spinner will display in the EDT Monitor
tab.

image::images/edt_monitor_spinner_in_action.gif[]

When the EDT monitor notices a relevant event, an item for it will be
added to the list in the EDT monitor tab.

image::images/edt_monitor_items.png[]

You can expand these items to see a stack trace indicating "where" they 
occurred. If you are using Swing Explorer inside an IDE with a plug-in,
these stack traces will include hyperlinks to the relevant lines in the
source code.

image::images/edt_monitor_items_expanded.png[]

The Options tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Options tab contains options controlling Swing Explorer's own behavior.
These include the outline colors used to highlight hovered-over
component boundaries, and whether preferred-size boundaries are shown.

Hacking on Swing Explorer
-------------------------

This section is for users who wish to develop Swing Explorer itself, or
create IDE plugins for use with it.

The source code for Swing Explorer can be found on GitHub at
